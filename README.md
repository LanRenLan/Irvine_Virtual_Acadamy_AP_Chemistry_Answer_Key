# Irvine_Virtual_Acadamy_AP_Chemistry_Answer_Key
This Repo is the archive of Irvine Virtual Acadamy AP Chemistry 2022~2023 Spring Semester answer keys, tests are mainly on AP Classroom, most of the questions could be answered by google and ChatGPT 4 with high correctness, but if you are not studying the content at all and counting on google, then it is challenge to get an A. AP Classroom never shuffle answer choices (ABCDE), never play tricks on numbers(changing the value of pH from 3 to 4 in a certain question while others are remained the same), but questions in the unit test may be altered by the teacher. Here I archived all the answers on the AP Classroom, files contain SHA256 to protect from any malicious alternations.
